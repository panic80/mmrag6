<p>Public Liability and Property Damage coverage is included in the daily rental rates provided by the government approved car rental suppliers.  When travelling outside Canada, travellers should ensure additional coverage is obtained where required.  In such circumstances, premiums for additional coverage will be reimbursed.</p>

<p>When Supplementary Business Insurance is required for the applicable period on government business travel, premium costs shall be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Travellers who intend to carry passengers are advised to confirm with their insurance agent that they are adequately insured.</p></div>

<p>Taxis, shuttles and local transportation services are alternatives for short local trips. Actual expenses, including gratuities, shall be reimbursed. Receipts are only required for expenses in excess of $12.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other modes of transportation<br /></strong></p>

<h4 id="s644-tc-tm_3_12">3.3.12 Weekend travel home</h4>
<p>The use of the weekend travel home provisions does not constitute a break in continuous travel at the same location.</p>
<p>An employee who is in travel status that extends through or beyond a weekend is eligible for weekend travel home provisions provided that the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>work schedules permit the employee to be absent; and</li>
<li>appropriate private or public transportation is available and its use is both practical and reasonable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every weekend:</p>
<p>An eligible employee entitled to travel home every weekend shall be reimbursed actual transportation costs up to an amount not exceeding:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>the cost of maintaining the employee in travel status for the weekend period (i.e., accommodation, meals, incidentals, and other expense allowances), if the accommodation is cancelled for the weekend; or</li>
<li>when the accommodation is not cancelled, the weekend travel home transportation allowances stated in Appendix C shall apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every third weekend on average:</p>
<p>There will be occasions when an employee in travel status for a period of more than 30 consecutive calendar days in Canada or the continental U.S.A. is so far from home that travel home every weekend would be impractical.</p>
<p>In such situations where travel home every weekend is impractical and provided that the employee is in continuous travel status, the employee may return home on average every third weekend and schedule actual weekend trips home within the maximum number permitted to meet personal needs.</p>
<p>The employee shall be reimbursed the most economical return airfare, the necessary return ground transportation to and from the carrier's terminal and meals en route. The lowest available airfares appropriate to particular itineraries shall be sought and bookings shall be made as far in advance as possible. Meals and incidentals at destination shall not be reimbursed. The accommodation at the duty travel location need not be cancelled.</p>
<h4 id="s644-tc-tm_3_13">3.3.13 Weekend travel - alternatives</h4>
<p>The use of the weekend travel alternatives does not constitute a break in continuous travel at the same location.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
<p><strong>By the employee<br /></strong></p>
<p>Provided that the employee is not required by the employer to remain at the duty travel location, an employee may choose to spend the weekend at an alternative location. To be eligible for reimbursement, the employee shall cancel charges for accommodation (and meals provided onsite) at the duty travel location; provide a receipt for alternative commercial accommodation when used; and not return home or to the headquarters area during the weekend.</p>
<p>Reimbursement shall be limited to the cost of maintaining the employee at the duty travel location and shall include the cost of accommodation, meals, incidentals and other expenses.</p>
<p>Arrangements are the personal responsibility of the employee without using the government-approved services. The employee assumes personal liability as if the employee were not in travel status.</p>
<p>The use of this provision does not preclude the employee's entitlement to weekend travel home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By the employee's spouse or a dependant<br /></strong></p>
As an alternative to weekend travel home by the employee, a spouse or a dependant may be authorized to travel to the employee's assigned work location when there is no additional cost to the employer. The airfare and pertinent travel arrangements shall be processed through the government suppliers. Ground transportation to and from the public carrier shall be reimbursed.

<p>In accordance with 1.6.1, government hotel directories shall be used for the selection of accommodation where properties are listed therein for the travel location. Where properties for a particular location are not listed, or are listed but not available for the travel period, the directories shall be used to help determine the cost of accommodation by comparing costs in similar nearby locations.</p>
<p>Unless the employer authorizes otherwise, when travel is related to activities held in an institution, the employee shall stay in institutional accommodations.</p>
<p>Where employees are in travel status at military bases, unless program-related or security reasons dictate the use of specific accommodation, an employee's request for alternate commercial or private non-commercial accommodation shall not be unreasonably denied.</p>
<p>Although travellers generally stay in commercial accommodation, private non-commercial accommodation is encouraged. A traveller who chooses private non-commercial accommodation shall be reimbursed the rate as specified in Appendix D. In addition, ground transportation costs shall be authorized when it is cost effective.

Meals and incidentals at destination shall not be reimbursed. The accommodation at the duty travel location need not be cancelled.</p>
<h4 id="s644-tc-tm_4_13">3.4.13 Weekend travel - alternatives</h4>
<p>The use of the weekend travel alternatives does not constitute a break in continuous travel at the same location.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
<p><strong style="">By the employee<br /></strong></p>
<p>Provided that the employee is not required by the employer to remain at the duty travel location, an employee may choose to spend the weekend at an alternative location. Such arrangements shall be made in consideration of security and diplomatic contexts. To be eligible for reimbursement, the employee shall cancel charges for accommodation (and meals provided on site) at the duty travel location; provide a receipt for alternative commercial accommodation when used; and not return home or to the headquarters area during the weekend.</p>
<p>Reimbursement shall be limited to the cost of maintaining the employee at the duty travel location and shall include the cost of accommodation, meals, incidentals and other expenses.</p>
<p>Arrangements are the personal responsibility of the employee without using the government approved services. The employee assumes personal liability as if the employee were not in travel status.</p>
<p>The use of this provision does not preclude the employee's entitlement to weekend travel home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By the employee's spouse or a dependant<br /></strong></p>
<p>As an alternative to weekend travel home by the employee, a spouse or a dependant may be authorized to travel to the employee's assigned work location when there is no additional cost to the employer. The airfare and pertinent travel arrangements shall be processed through government suppliers. Ground transportation to and from the public carrier shall be reimbursed. Such arrangements shall be made in consideration of security and diplomatic contexts. Insurance coverage for the spouse/dependant is the responsibility of the employee.</p>

					<div class="section-content"><h3 id="s645-tc-tm_1">4.1 Escort Officers</h3>
<p>4.1.1 A suitable rest period for employees who are employed as Escort Officers shall be 16 hours for travel time between 8 and 24 hours; for travel time greater than 24 hours, a suitable rest period shall be 24 hours.</p>
<p>Travel time is the time spent in any mode of transportation en route to destination and/or awaiting immediate connections. This includes the time spent travelling to and from a carrier's terminal.</p>
<h3 id="s645-tc-tm_2">4.2 Ships Officers / Ships Crews</h3>
<p>4.2.1 The workplace of employees who are employed as Ships' Officers or Ships' Crews shall be deemed to be a suitable structure, as determined by the employer:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>at the location of the home port of their vessels, for employees whose normal duties are performed aboard a vessel; or</li>
<li>at the location where employees normally perform their duties when they are not employed on a vessel.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.2.2 For any period during which the employer requires the employee to be aboard a self-contained vessel (e.g. a ship, dredge or barge with sleeping and eating facilities), an employee shall be deemed to be within the headquarters area, whether or not the vessel is actually within the headquarters area. In this context, "period" shall mean the extended period during which the employee is assigned to the vessel, and shall not be limited to the actual physical performance of particular tasks during a watch.</p>
<p>4.2.3 When the self-contained vessel itself is outside the actual headquarters area, the employee shall be in travel status whenever required by the employer to leave the vessel and go ashore (except when billeted ashore), and when, during such absence, the employee remains outside the actual headquarters area.</p>
<p>4.2.4 Travel status applies in the circumstances described above when the employee is on sick leave. It does not apply when the employee is on leave of absence. During a period of leave of absence, however, the employee shall be entitled to any appropriate travel provisions contained in the employee's collective agreement, where such provisions are applicable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>4.2.5 Entitlement to accommodation expenses and meal and incidental expense allowances during each period of required absence from the vessel shall be governed by this directive as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no entitlements in respect of meals and accommodation while the employee is ashore if appropriate entitlements in such circumstances are provided for in a collective agreement applicable to the employee.</p>
<p>4.2.6 Except as otherwise provided for in a collective agreement, for purposes of weekend travel home, an employee shall be deemed not to be in travel status for the period during which the normal duties of that employee are performed aboard a self-contained vessel.</p>
<p>4.2.7 The provisions concerning emergency or death while away on government travel shall apply to employees who are Ships' Officers, Ships' Crews or other occupational groups and who are serving aboard a vessel while absent from its home port, as if the employees were in travel status.</p>
<p>4.2.8 Over each contiguous three-day period away from home port, employees on board vessels shall be authorized to make up the equivalent of a ten minute phone call home using the equipment available. When satellite communication systems are available and used, the phone calls shall be limited to five minutes.</p>
<h3 id="s645-tc-tm_3">4.3 Special transportation needs</h3>
<p>4.3.1 When a traveller has an aversion to air travel, the employer shall endeavour to schedule the work so that time will permit the traveller to travel by other means.</p></div>

					<h2>Part V - Emergencies, Illnesses, Injuries and Death while in Travel Status</h2>
					<div class="section-content"><h3 id="s646-tc-tm_1">5.1 Death while in travel status</h3>
<p>5.1.1 If an employee dies while in travel status, the employer shall authorize the payment of necessary expenses that are additional to those which might have been incurred had the death occurred in the headquarters area. Reimbursement of costs incurred shall be reduced by any amount payable under some other authority. Expenses payable are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>at the place where death occurred: ambulance, hearse, embalming/cremation, outside crate/container (but not the cost of a coffin/urn) and any other services or items required by local health laws; and</li>
<li>transportation of the remains to the headquarters area or, if desired by the survivors, to another location, up to the cost of transportation to the headquarters area. Costs for an escort over and above the costs included in transporting the remains are payable only when an escort is required by law.</li>
</ol>
<p>5.1.2 Where the remains are not transported, travel for next-of-kin or a representative of the family to the place of burial shall be reimbursed as though that person were an employee.</p>
<h3 id="s646-tc-tm_2">5.2 Emergencies, illnesses and injuries while in travel status</h3>
<p>5.2.1 Payment for the use of a suitable conveyance, such as an ambulance or taxi, shall be authorized where an employee becomes ill or is injured when, in the opinion of the employer, the employee, or the attending medical practitioner, the nature of the illness or injury requires that the employee be transported to a medical treatment facility, the workplace, the travel-related accommodation, or home.</p>
<p>5.2.2 An employee shall be reimbursed the necessary expenses incurred as a result of illness or accident occurring while in travel status, to the extent that the employer is satisfied the expenses were additional to those which might have been incurred had the employee not been absent from home, and which were not otherwise payable to the employee under an insurance policy, the <em>Government Employees Compensation Act</em>, or other authority.</p>
<p>5.2.3 An employee who becomes ill or is injured while outside Canada shall, where practical, be provided with a justifiable, accountable advance when incurring sizeable medical expenses. Such advances would subsequently be repaid to the employer under the employee's private insurance plans, the <em>Government Employees Compensation Act</em>, or other authority.</p>
<p>5.2.4 When, in the opinion of the attending physician, an employee's condition resulting from illness or injury warrants the presence of the next-of-kin or a representative of the family, actual and reasonable travel expenses may be reimbursed, as if that person were an employee.</p>
<p>5.2.5 An employee may be authorized to return earlier than scheduled as a result of personal illness or accident, or in the event of emergency situations at home (e.g. serious illness in the opinion of a physician, fire, flood, ice storm).</p>
<p>5.2.6 A trip home under this section shall not be taken into account when establishing the employee's eligibility for weekend travel home.</p>
<p>5.2.7 When a trip home for reasons specified in this section is not warranted, actual and reasonable expenses incurred for long-distance telephone calls home shall be reimbursed.</p></div>
